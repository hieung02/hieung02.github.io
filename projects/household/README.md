Household builder
=================

In the given index.js file, JavaScript can:

* Validate data entry (age is required and > 0, relationship is required)
* Add people to a growing household list
* Remove a previously added person from the list
* Display the household list in the HTML as it is modified
* Serialize the household as JSON upon form submission as a fake trip to the server

Notes

Hi,

I coded everything in Javascript. I didn't focus too much on css. I also used the localStorage to store new household members.
